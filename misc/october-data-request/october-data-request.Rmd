I can get poverty data at the 100% and 200% levels on kids 6 and under, but not under 5. See table [B17024 from the ACS](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B17024/), which is where people seem to get the 100% + 200% FPL data from (see, for example, the source on the [Kids Count website](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/47-children-below-200-percent-poverty?loc=39&loct=2#detailed/2/39/false/37,871,870,573,869,36,868,867,133,38/any/329,330)). There is data on under 5 (see [here](https://censusreporter.org/tables/B17001/)) but it is dichotomous (i.e. someone is counted as in poverty or not).



```{r, layout="l-page"}

children_in_poverty %>%

# Single Parent Households with children under 5 and Under 200% FPL

I'm not sure this data is available. There is data for family type and for poverty levels, but not the two together.

# Specific Racial and Ethnic Groups under 200% FPL

Here is the note from the email:

> I know there may be limitations on the data for some of the groups below. Currently the only categories where we would want to look at the Hispanic ethnic category would be Latino & Two or More races. I think if we get into Hispanic â€“ Black, Hispanic- White it gets complicated really quickly. Open to suggestion on these listings if we need to have a discussion.)

I've showed this below using various racial groups for all children under 6.

# Geospatial Data

## Maps

```{r}
# Created using http://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Accent&n=3

color_school_catchment_areas <- "#7fc97f"
color_census_tracts <- "#beaed4"
color_zctas <- "#fdc086"
```


Note from email:

> Also, it would be helpful if you could look into which census tracts fit into related zip codes, elementary catchments and school districts. I think we are going to have to deal with overlapping boundaries as we move into mapping, so getting that data now would be helpful. 

### School Catchment Areas

I downloaded data from [here](https://spatialdata.oregonexplorer.info/geoportal/details;id=1270fe6e833f4d0eabacc71300069738) to get school catchment area data.

```{r results = "hide"}
wash_co_school_catchment_areas <- st_read("SchoolYear_2015_2016.gdb",
                                          layer = "EDUCATIONAL_BOUNDARIES") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  filter(county_name_alt == "Washington") %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326)
```

Hover on the map to see the associated school.

```{r, layout="l-page"}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addPolygons(data = wash_co_school_catchment_areas,
              label = wash_co_school_catchment_areas$grade_1_name_1,
              fillColor = color_school_catchment_areas,
              color = color_school_catchment_areas,
              weight = 1,
              opacity = 0.5)
```


### Census Tracts

Hover on any tract to see its number.

```{r}
wash_co_census_tracts <- tracts(
  state = "OR",
  county = "Washington"
) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  st_transform(crs = 4326) 
```

```{r, layout="l-page"}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>%
  addPolygons(data = wash_co_census_tracts,
              label = wash_co_census_tracts$geoid,
              fillColor = color_census_tracts,
              color = color_census_tracts,
              weight = 1,
              opacity = 0.5)
```

## Table

I can work on making a table that looks like this.

![](https://d2ddoduugvun08.cloudfront.net/items/2A2O3q1c2x2l2r2v1p0h/Image%202019-10-29%20at%2012.00.13%20PM.png?X-CloudApp-Visitor-Id=2914590&v=01ee9f64)

It's proving a bit more complicated than I originally thought it would. I can likely do it, just not by Wednesday.

```{r}
master_table <- wash_co_census_tracts %>% 
  left_join(children_in_poverty)
```
